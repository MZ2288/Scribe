Quick start
-----------
1. Use straight away:

    ~~~jsx
    /*
    Include `quill.base.css` to give the editor some basic styles it needs.
    You can find the _base_ theme in the quill distribution or inside
    `node_modules`.
    */

    var React = require('react');
    var ReactQuill = require('react-quill');

    var MyComponent = React.createClass({
      /* ... */

      render: function() {
        return (
          <ReactQuill value={this.state.value} />
        );
      }
    });
    ~~~

2. Customize a few settings:

    ~~~jsx
    /*
    Include a theme like `quill.snow.css` and activate it in the
    configuration like shown below. You can find the _snow_ theme in the
    quill distribution or inside `node_modules`.
    */

    var MyComponent = React.createClass({
      /* ... */

      onTextChange: function(value) {
        this.setState({ text:value });
      },

      render: function() {
        return (
          <ReactQuill theme="snow"
                      value={this.state.text}
                      onChange={this.onTextChange} />
        );
      }
    });
    ~~~

3. Custom controls:

    ~~~jsx
    var MyComponent = React.createClass({
      /* ... */

      render: function() {
        return (
          <ReactQuill>
            <ReactQuill.Toolbar key="toolbar"
                                ref="toolbar"
                                items={ReactQuill.Toolbar.defaultItems} />
            <div key="editor"
                 ref="editor"
                 className="quill-contents"
                 dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html:this.getEditorContents()}} />
          </ReactQuill>
        );
      }
    });
    ~~~

4. Mixing in:

    ~~~jsx
    var MyComponent = React.createClass({
      mixins: [ ReactQuill.Mixin ],

      componentDidMount: function() {
        var editor = this.createEditor(
          this.getEditorElement(),
          this.getEditorConfig()
        );
        this.setState({ editor:editor });
      },

      componentWillReceiveProps: function(nextProps) {
        if ('value' in nextProps && nextProps.value !== this.props.value) {
          this.setEditorContents(this.state.editor, nextProps.value);
        }
      },

      /* ... */
    });
    ~~~

    See [component.js](src/component.js) for a fully fleshed-out example.


Bundling with Webpack
---------------------
Quill ships only a pre-built javascript file, so Webpack will complain:

~~~
Error: ./~/react-quill/~/quill/dist/quill.js
Critical dependencies:
6:478-485 This seems to be a pre-built javascript file. Though this is possible, it's not recommended. Try to require the original source to get better results.
@ ./~/react-quill/~/quill/dist/quill.js 6:478-485
~~~

The warning is harmless, but if you want to silence it you can avoid parsing Quill by adding this to your Webpack configuration:

~~~js
module: {
  // Shut off warnings about using pre-built javascript files
  // as Quill.js unfortunately ships one as its `main`.
  noParse: /node_modules\/quill\/dist/
}
~~~

See [#7](https://github.com/zenoamaro/react-quill/issues/7) for more details.


API reference
-------------

### Props

`id`
: ID to be applied to the DOM element.

`className`
: Classes to be applied to the DOM element.

`value`
: Value for the editor as a controlled component. Note that due to limitations in Quill, this is actually a _semi-controlled_ mode, meaning that the edit is not prevented, but changing `value` will still replace the contents.

`defaultValue`
: Initial value for the editor as an uncontrolled component.

`readOnly`
: If true, the editor won't allow changing its contents.

`modules`
: An object specifying what modules are enabled, and their configuration. See the [modules section](http://quilljs.com/docs/modules/) over the Quill documentation for more information on what modules are available.

`toolbar`
: A list of toolbar items to use as custom configuration for the toolbar. Defaults (that also double as reference) are available as [`ReactQuill.Toolbar.defaultItems`](src/toolbar.js#L21) and [`ReactQuill.Toolbar.defaultColors`](src/toolbar.js#L6). See also the [Toolbar module](http://quilljs.com/docs/modules/toolbar/) over the Quill documentation for more information on the inner workings.

`formats`
: An array of formats to be enabled during editing. All implemented formats are enabled by default. See [Formats](http://quilljs.com/docs/formats/) for a list. Also accepts definitions of custom formats:
```javascript
[
  "list",
  "bullet",
  "bold",
  "italic",
  { name: "h1", tag: "H1", prepare: "heading", type: "line" },
  { name: "h2", tag: "H2", prepare: "heading", type: "line" },
  { name: "h3", tag: "H3", prepare: "heading", type: "line" }
];
```

`style`
: An object with custom CSS rules to apply on the editor's container. Rules should be in React's "camelCased" naming style.

`styles`
: An object with custom CSS selectors and rules to add to the editor. Neither should be in "camelCased" style. Pass `false` to prevent Quill from injecting any style at all (except for text formats). See [configuration](http://quilljs.com/docs/configuration/) for details.

`theme`
: The name of the theme to apply to the editor. Defaults to `base`.

`pollInterval`
: Interval in ms between checks for local changes in editor contents.

`onChange(value, delta, source)`
: Called back with the new contents of the editor after change.

`onChangeSelection(range, source)`
: Called back with the new selected range, or null when unfocused.

`onKeyPress(event)`
: Called after a key has been pressed and released.
: Note that, like its native counterpart, this won't be called for special keys such as <kbd>shift</kbd> or <kbd>enter</kbd>. If you need those, hook onto `onKeyDown` or `onKeyUp`.

`onKeyDown(event)`
: Called after a key has been pressed, but before it is released.
: Note that, due to how Quill works, it's possible that you won't receive events for keys such as <kbd>enter</kbd>, <kbd>backspace</kbd> or <kbd>delete</kbd>. If that's the case, try hooking onto `onKeyUp` instead.

`onKeyUp(event)`
: Called after a key has been released.


### Methods

If you have [a ref to a ReactQuill node](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html), you will be able to invoke the following methods:

`focus()`
: Focuses the editor.

`blur()`
: Removes focus from the editor.


Building and testing
--------------------
You can run the automated test suite:

    $ npm test

And build a minificated version of the source:

    $ npm run build

More tasks are available on the [Makefile](Makefile):

    lint: lints the source
    spec: runs the test specs
    coverage: runs the code coverage test
    test: lint, spec and coverage threshold test
    build: builds the minified version


Changelog
---------
#### v0.2.2
